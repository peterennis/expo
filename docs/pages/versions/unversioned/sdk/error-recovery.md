### `ErrorRecovery.setRecoveryProps(props)`

Set arbitrary error recovery props. If your project crashes in production as a result of a fatal JS error, Expo will reload your project. If you've set these props, they'll be passed to your reloaded project's initial props under `exp.errorRecovery`. [Read more about error handling with Expo](../../guides/errors/).

#### Arguments

- **props (_object_)** -- An object which will be passed to your reloaded project's initial props if the project was reloaded as a result of a fatal JS error.
