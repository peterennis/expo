## API

```js
import { LinearGradient } from 'expo-linear-gradient';
```

### props

`colors`  
An array of colors that represent stops in the gradient. At least two colors are required (otherwise it's not a gradient, it's just a fill!).

`start`  
An array of `[x, y]` where x and y are floats. They represent the position that the gradient starts at, as a fraction of the overall size of the gradient. For example, `[0.1, 0.2]` means that the gradient will start 10% from the left and 20% from the top.

`end`  
Same as start but for the end of the gradient.

`locations`  
An array of the same length as `colors`, where each element is a float with the same meaning as the `start` and `end` values, but instead they indicate where the color at that index should be.
