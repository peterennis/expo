**`expo-sharing`** allows you to share files directly with other compatible applications.

<Video file={"sdk/sharing.mp4"} loop={false} />

<PlatformsSection android emulator ios simulator web />

<br />

> üö® **Web browser support**: expo-sharing for web is built on top of the Web Share API, which still has [very limited browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-share). Be sure to check that the API can be used before calling it by using `Sharing.isAvailableAsync()`.

<br/>

> üí° **HTTPS required on web**: The Web Share API is only available on web when the page is served over https. Run your app with `expo start --https` to enable it.

<br/>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **No local file sharing on web**: Sharing local files by URI works on iOS and Android, but not on web. You cannot share local files on web by URI &mdash; you will need to upload them somewhere and share that URI.
