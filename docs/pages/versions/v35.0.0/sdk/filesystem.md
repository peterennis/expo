title: FileSystem
---

Provides access to a file system stored locally on the device. Within the Expo client, each app has a separate file systems and has no access to the file system of other Expo apps.

## Installation

For [managed](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/#managed-workflow) apps, you'll need to run `expo install expo-file-system`. To use it in a [bare](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow) React Native app, follow its [installation instructions](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-file-system).

## API

```js
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system';
```

The API takes `file://` URIs pointing to local files on the device to identify files. Each app only has read and write access to locations under the following directories:

- **`FileSystem.documentDirectory`**

`file://` URI pointing to the directory where user documents for this app will be stored. Files stored here will remain until explicitly deleted by the app. Ends with a trailing `/`. Example uses are for files the user saves that they expect to see again.

- **`FileSystem.cacheDirectory`**

`file://` URI pointing to the directory where temporary files used by this app will be stored. Files stored here may be automatically deleted by the system when low on storage. Example uses are for downloaded or generated files that the app just needs for one-time usage.

So, for example, the URI to a file named `'myFile'` under `'myDirectory'` in the app's user documents directory would be `FileSystem.documentDirectory + 'myDirectory/myFile'`.

Expo APIs that create files generally operate within these directories. This includes `Audio` recordings, `Camera` photos, `ImagePicker` results, `SQLite` databases and `takeSnapShotAsync()` results. This allows their use with the `FileSystem` API.

Some `FileSystem` functions are able to read from (but not write to) other locations. Currently `FileSystem.getInfoAsync()` and `FileSystem.copyAsync()` are able to read from URIs returned by [`CameraRoll.getPhotos()`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/cameraroll.html#getphotos) from React Native.

- **`FileSystem.EncodingType`**

These constants can be used to define how data is read / written.

- **FileSystem.EncodingType.UTF8** -- Standard readable format.

- **FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64** -- Binary, radix-64 representation.

### `FileSystem.getInfoAsync(fileUri, options)`

Get metadata information about a file or directory.

#### Arguments

- **fileUri (_string_)** -- `file://` URI to the file or directory, or a URI returned by [`CameraRoll.getPhotos()`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/cameraroll.html#getphotos).

- **options (_object_)** -- A map of options:

  - **md5 (_boolean_)** -- Whether to return the MD5 hash of the file. `false` by default.

  - **size (_boolean_)** -- Whether to include the size of the file if operating on a source from [`CameraRoll.getPhotos()`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/cameraroll.html#getphotos) (skipping this can prevent downloading the file if it's stored in iCloud, for example). The size is always returned for `file://` locations.

#### Returns

If no item exists at this URI, returns a Promise that resolves to `{ exists: false, isDirectory: false }`. Else returns an object with the following fields:

- **exists (_boolean_)** -- `true`.

- **isDirectory (_boolean_)** -- `true` if this is a directory, `false` if it is a file

- **modificationTime (_number_)** -- The last modification time of the file expressed in seconds since epoch.

- **size (_number_)** -- The size of the file in bytes. If operating on a source from [`CameraRoll.getPhotos()`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/cameraroll.html#getphotos), only present if the `size` option was truthy.

- **uri (_string_)** -- A `file://` URI pointing to the file. This is the same as the `fileUri` input parameter.

- **md5 (_string_)** -- Present if the `md5` option was truthy. Contains the MD5 hash of the file.

### `FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(fileUri, options)`

Read the entire contents of a file as a string. Binary will be returned in raw format, you will need to append `data:image/png;base64,` to use it as Base64.

#### Arguments

- **fileUri (_string_)** -- `file://` URI to the file or directory.

- **options (_object_)** -- Optional props that define how a file must be read.

  - **encoding (_EncodingType_)** -- The encoding format to use when reading the file. Options: `FileSystem.EncodingType.UTF8`, `FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64`. Default is `FileSystem.EncodingType.UTF8`.

  - **length (_number_)** -- Optional number of bytes to read. This option is only used when `encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64` and `position` is defined.

  - **position (_number_)** -- Optional number of bytes to skip. This option is only used when `encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64` and `length` is defined.

#### Returns

A Promise that resolves to a string containing the entire contents of the file.

### `FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync(fileUri, contents, options)`

Write the entire contents of a file as a string.

#### Arguments

- **fileUri (_string_)** -- `file://` URI to the file or directory.

### `FileSystem.copyAsync(options)`

Create a copy of a file or directory. Directories are recursively copied with all of their contents.

#### Arguments

- **options (_object_)** -- A map of options:

  - **from (_string_)** -- `file://` URI to the file or directory to copy, or a URI returned by [`CameraRoll.getPhotos()`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/cameraroll.html#getphotos).

Enumerate the contents of a directory.

#### Arguments

- **fileUri (_string_)** -- `file://` URI to the directory.

#### Returns

A Promise that resolves to an array of strings, each containing the name of a file or directory contained in the directory at `fileUri`.

### `FileSystem.downloadAsync(uri, fileUri, options)`

Download the contents at a remote URI to a file in the app's file system. The directory for a local file uri must exist prior to calling this function.

#### Example

  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

### `FileSystem.createDownloadResumable(uri, fileUri, options, callback, resumeData)`

Create a `DownloadResumable` object which can start, pause, and resume a download of contents at a remote URI to a file in the app's file system. Please note: You need to call `downloadAsync()`, on a `DownloadResumable` instance to initiate the download. The `DownloadResumable` object has a callback that provides download progress updates. Downloads can be resumed across app restarts by using `AsyncStorage` to store the `DownloadResumable.savable()` object for later retrieval. The `savable` object contains the arguments required to initialize a new `DownloadResumable` object to resume the download after an app restart. The directory for a local file uri must exist prior to calling this function.

#### Arguments

- **url (_string_)** -- The remote URI to download from.

- **fileUri (_string_)** -- The local URI of the file to download to. If there is no file at this URI, a new one is created. If there is a file at this URI, its contents are replaced. The directory for the file must exist.

- **options (_object_)** -- A map of options:

  - **md5 (_boolean_)** -- If `true`, include the MD5 hash of the file in the returned object. `false` by default. Provided for convenience since it is common to check the integrity of a file immediately after downloading.

  - **headers (_object_)** -- An object containing any additional HTTP header fields required for the request. The keys and values of the object are the header names and values respectively.

- **callback (_function_)** --
  This function is called on each data write to update the download progress. An object with the following fields are passed:

  - **totalBytesWritten (_number_)** -- The total bytes written by the download operation.
  - **totalBytesExpectedToWrite (_number_)** -- The total bytes expected to be written by the download operation.

- **resumeData (_string_)** -- The string which allows the api to resume a paused download. This is set on the `DownloadResumable` object automatically when a download is paused. When initializing a new `DownloadResumable` this should be `null`.

### `FileSystem.DownloadResumable.downloadAsync()`

Download the contents at a remote URI to a file in the app's file system.

- **headers (_object_)** -- An object containing all the HTTP header fields and their values for the download network request. The keys and values of the object are the header names and values respectively.

- **md5 (_string_)** -- Present if the `md5` option was truthy. Contains the MD5 hash of the file.

### `FileSystem.DownloadResumable.pauseAsync()`

Pause the current download operation. `resumeData` is added to the `DownloadResumable` object after a successful pause operation. Returns an object that can be saved with `AsyncStorage` for future retrieval (the same object that is returned from calling `FileSystem.DownloadResumable.savable()`. Please see the example below.

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to an object with the following fields:

- **url (_string_)** -- The remote URI to download from.

- **options (_object_)** -- A map of options:

  - **md5 (_boolean_)** -- If `true`, include the MD5 hash of the file in the returned object. `false` by default. Provided for convenience since it is common to check the integrity of a file immediately after downloading.

- **resumeData (_string_)** -- The string which allows the API to resume a paused download.

### `FileSystem.DownloadResumable.resumeAsync()`

Resume a paused download operation.

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to an object with the following fields:

- **uri (_string_)** -- A `file://` URI pointing to the file. This is the same as the `fileUri` input parameter.

- **options (_object_)** -- A map of options:

  - **md5 (_boolean_)** -- If `true`, include the MD5 hash of the file in the returned object. `false` by default. Provided for convenience since it is common to check the integrity of a file immediately after downloading.

- **resumeData (_string_)** -- The string which allows the api to resume a paused download.

### `FileSystem.getContentUriAsync(fileUri)`

Take a `file://` URI and convert it into content URI (`content://`) so that it can be access by other applications outside of Expo.

#### Example

```javascript
FileSystem.getContentUriAsync(uri).then(cUri => {
  console.log(cUri);
  IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync('android.intent.action.VIEW', {
    data: cUri.uri,
    flags: 1,
  });
});
```

#### Arguments

- **fileUri (_string_)** -- The local URI of the file. If there is no file at this URI, an exception will be thrown.

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to an object with the following fields:

- **uri (_string_)** -- A `content://` URI pointing to the file. This is the same as the `fileUri` input parameter but in different format.
