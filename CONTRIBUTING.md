Thanks so much for coming to help! Currently we review PRs for `packages/`, `docs/`, `templates/`, `guides/`, `apps/`, and markdown files. Because the native clients (`ios/`, `android/`) are difficult to setup and require API tokens, not much progress can be made externally (but you can always try!). We've moved most of the fun code out of the client anyways to support the **bare-workflow**; this means that you'll do the majority of your native testing in a bare Expo project.

As you might imagine web code is very easy to test and contribute to, so that's all on the table! You may find that some of the web features you're looking for are actually in the [expo-cli repo](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli).

## üì¶ Download and Setup

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device. (`git remote add upstream git@github.com:expo/expo.git` üòâ)
2. Run the setup script with: `npm run setup:native` (if you just want to contribute to the docs, you can run `npm run setup:docs`). This command does the following for you:

   <!-- TODO(Bacon): Split this into 2 scripts so people can contribute to docs without installing React Native -->

   - Downloads submodules (like `react-native`) with `git submodule update --init`
   - Fetches files with [_git lfs_](https://git-lfs.github.com), which we use for big native libraries like Google Mobile Vision. Note: you must have `git lfs` already installed.
   - Ensures Yarn is installed
   - Ensures your computer is set up for React Native (will install the Android NDK if it's not present)
   - Downloads the Node packages (`yarn install`)

3. Navigate to the bare sandbox project `cd apps/bare-expo`
4. Run the project on any platform (maybe start with web; it's the fastest! üòÅ)

   - Web: `yarn web`
   - iOS: `yarn ios`
   - Android: `yarn android`

> If this didn't work for you as described, please [open an issue.](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/new/choose)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Editing Packages

All of our packages (including Foundation Unimodules) can be found in the `packages/` directory. These packages are automatically linked to the projects in the `apps/` directory (meaning any iOS, Android, web, or API changes can be tested from `apps/bare-expo/`). `bare-expo` is a bare workflow Expo app that acts as a runner for the other projects in the `apps/` directory.

- `native-component-list`: This is where you can write demos or tests that require physical interaction (a good playground for testing).
- `test-suite`: You can write your E2E tests in here. When pushed to the remote, CI will run this project with Device Farm for Android, Detox for iOS, and Puppeteer for web!

All modules should adhere to the style guides which can be found here:

- [Guide to Unimodule Development](guides/Expo%20Universal%20Module%20Infrastructure.md)
- [Expo JS Style Guide](guides/Expo%20JavaScript%20Style%20Guide.md) (also mostly applies to TypeScript)

1. Navigate to a package you want to edit. Ex: `cd packages/expo-constants`
2. Start the TypeScript build in watch mode: `yarn build`
3. Edit code in that package's `src/` directory
4. Play with your changes on a simulator or device through `bare-expo`:
   - Add or modify a file named after the API you're working on. Ex: `apps/test-suite/tests/Constants.js`
   - Run the code from the `bare-expo` project with `yarn <android | ios | web>` or test the code with `yarn test:<ios | web>`
5. You can edit a package's native code directly from its respective folder in the `packages/` directory or by opening `bare-expo` in a native editor:
   - Android Studio: `yarn edit:android`
   - Xcode: `yarn edit:ios`
   - Remember to **rebuild** the native project whenever you make a native change

### Extra Credit

- The React Native dev tools are currently disabled in our fork [#5602](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/5602). You can hack around this by cloning React Native outside this repo, then copying the contents `react-native/React/DevSupport` into `expo/react-native-lab/react-native/React/DevSupport` (this will only enable the shake gesture, CMD+R won't work yet).
- We use a fork of `react-native` in this repo; this fork is located at `react-native-lab/react-native` (you can make changes or cherry-picks from here if you want). It diverges the minimal amount necessary from the `react-native` version in its `package.json`.
- All of the package's `build/` code should be committed. This is because it is simpler to reproduce issues if all contributors are running the same code and so we don't need to rebuild dozen of packages locally on every `git pull` or `git checkout` operation.
- We use a unified set of basic Bash scripts and configs called `expo-module-scripts` to ensure everything runs smoothly (TypeScript, Babel, Jest, etc...).

## ‚è± Testing Your Changes

> You'll need write about how you tested your changes in the PR under the **Test Plan** section.

The best way to get your changes merged is to build good tests for them! We have three different kinds of tests: unit-tests, automated E2E tests, and demos (adding tests that you notice are missing is a great way to become my friend ü•≥)!

### ‚úÖ Unit Testing

1. Create a test for your feature in the appropriate package's `src/__tests__` directory (if the file doesn't exist already, create it with the `*-test.ts` or `*-test.tsx` extension).
2. Run the test with `yarn test` and ensure it handles all platforms (iOS, Android, and web). If the feature doesn't support a platform, then you can exclude it by putting your test in a file with a platform extension like: `-test.ios.ts`, `-test.native.ts`, `-test.web.ts`...
3. You can also test platforms one at a time by pressing `X` and selecting the platform you want to test!

### üèÅ E2E Testing

1. Write your tests in `apps/test-suite/tests`
   - These tests are written with a non-feature-complete version of Jasmine that runs on the Android and iOS clients, so no special features like snapshot testing will be available.
   - If you created a new test file, be sure to add it in `apps/test-suite/TestUtils.js`. This is where you can do platform exclusion. Use `global.DETOX` to test for iOS tests, and `ExponentTest.isInCI` to test for Android Device Farm.
2. Run your tests locally from the `bare-expo` directory with `yarn test:ios`, or `yarn test:web`.
    <!-- TODO(Bacon): Remove once Android Detox is setup -->
   - For the moment Android Detox is not set up, but you can still run the project in an emulator or on a device to test it.
   - It's important you test locally because native CI tests can be fragile, take a while to finish, and be frustrating when they fail.
   - When testing for web, you can set `headless: false` in the `apps/bare-expo/jest-puppeteer.config.js` to watch the tests live. You can also execute `await jestPuppeteer.debug();` in `apps/bare-expo/e2e/TestSuite-test.web.js` to pause the tests and debug them!
3. Remember to try and get your feature running on as many platforms as possible.

Thanks again for helping to make sure that Expo is stable for everyone!

## üìö Updating Documentation

Our docs are made with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js). They're located in the `docs/` directory. For more information look at the [`docs/readme.md`](/docs/README.md).

**TL;DR:**

1. Navigate to the `docs/` directory and run `yarn`.
2. Start the project with `yarn dev` (make sure you don't have another server running on port `3000`).
3. Navigate to the docs you want to edit: `cd docs/pages/versions/unversioned/`
4. If you update an older version, ensure the relevant changes are copied into `unversioned/`

## üìù Writing a Commit Message

> If this is your first time committing to a large public repo, you could look through this neat tutorial: ["How to Write a Git Commit Message"](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

Commit messages are most useful when formatted like so: `[platform][api] Title`. For example if you fix a bug in the package `expo-video` for iOS, you could write: `[ios][video] Fixed black screen bug that appears on older devices`.

## üîé Before Submitting

To help keep CI green, please make sure of the following:

- Remember to add a concise description of the change to [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md). This is especially helpful for breaking changes!
- If you modified anything in `packages/`:
  - You transpiled the TypeScript with `yarn build` in the directory of whichever package you modified.
  - Run `yarn lint --fix` to fix the formatting of the code. Ensure that `yarn lint` succeeds without errors or warnings.
  - Run `yarn test` to ensure all existing tests pass for that package, along with any new tests you would've written.
  - All `console.log`s or commented out code blocks are removed! :]
- If you edited the `docs/`:
  - Any change to the current SDK version should also be in the unversioned copy as well. Example:
    - You fixed a typo in `docs/pages/versions/vXX.0.0/sdk/app-auth.md`
    - Ensure you copy that change to: `docs/pages/versions/unversioned/sdk/app-auth.md`
  - You don't need to run the docs tests locally. Just ensure the links you include aren't broken, and the format is correct!

### Extra Credit

- Our CI tests will finish early if you didn't make changes to certain directories. If you want to **get results faster** then you should make changes to `docs/` in one PR, and changes to anything else in another!
