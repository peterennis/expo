Contrary to popular belief, there are sometimes better ways to debug than putting `console.log` all over your code. There are plenty of tools and libraries that can improve the debugging experience. This document will explain how to use some of the most commonly useful tools.

## Prerequisites

- You should have Expo CLI and Expo client installed as described on the ["Installation" page](../../get-started/installation).
- It's usually easier to test and debug using a simulator, so we recommend setting up the [iOS Simulator](../../workflow/ios-simulator/) and/or the [Android Emulator](../../workflow/android-studio-emulator/) before continuing.

## Errors and warnings

In development it won't be long before you encounter a "Redbox" error or "Yellowbox" warning.

Redbox errors will show when a fatal error has occurred that prevents your app from running. Warnings will show to let you know of a _possible_ issue that you should probably look into before shipping your app.

You can also create warnings and errors on your own with `console.warn("Warning message")` and `console.error("Error message")`. Another way to trigger the redbox is to throw an error and not catch it: `throw Error("Error message")`.

### Redbox errors and stack traces

When you encounter an error during development, you will be shown the error message, as well as the "stacktrace," which is a report of the recent calls your application made or was making when it crashed. This stacktrace is shown both in your terminal and in the Expo client app.

This stacktrace is **extremely valuable** since it gives you the location the error comes from. For example, in the following clip we know that the error came from the file `LinksScreen.js` on line 10 and column (character) 15.

## Developer menu

This menu gives you access to several functions which are useful for debugging. The way you open it is a bit different depending on where you're running the Expo client:

- iOS Device: Shake the device a little bit.
- iOS Simulator: Hit `Ctrl-Cmd-Z` on a Mac in the emulator to simulate the shake gesture, or press `Cmd+D`.
- Android Device: Shake the device vertically a little bit, or run `adb shell input keyevent 82` in your terminal window if your device is connected via USB.
- Android Emulator: Either hit `Cmd+M`, or run `adb shell input keyevent 82` in your terminal window.

The Developer Menu gives you a couple different functionalities. A few are pretty self-explanatory, like:

- Reload manifest & JS bundle: this will reload your app. Usually this isn't necessary if you have Live or Hot Reload enabled, since it will automatically refresh whenever you save your changes in your text editor.
- Go to Expo Home: Leave your app and navigate back to the Expo Client homescreen
- Enable/Disable Live Reload: When enabled, your app will automatically refresh the JS bundle whenever you save file changes in your proejct directory.

> **Note**: In order to use Live Reload, your components must be **class** components, rather than a functional components. You can read about their differences [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components).

Now let's explore some of the more exciting functionalities...

#### Show Performance Monitor

This opens up a small window giving you performance information of your app. You will see:

- RAM usage of your project
- Javascript heap (this is an easy way to know of any memory leaks in your application)
- 2 numbers for Views, the top indicates the number of views for the screen, the bottom indicates the number of views in the component
- Frames Per Second for the UI and JS threads. The UI thread is used for native Android or iOS UI rendering. The JS thread is where most of your logic will be run, including API calls, touch events, etc.

#### Toggle Element Inspector & Debug Remote JS

Both of these work best in tandem with either `react-native-debugger` or `react-devtools`. Read on to see more!

## React Native Debugger

The React Native Debugger includes a lot of the tools listed later in this page, all bundled into one, including React-DevTools ([guide below](#debugging-with-react-devtools)) and network request inspection. For this reason, if you use one tool on this page, it should probably be this one!

We'll give a quick look at it here, but check out their [documentation](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger#documentation) for a more in-depth look.

You can install it via the [release page](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases), or if you're on a mac you can run:

```sh
brew cask install react-native-debugger
```

### Startup
After firing up React Native Debugger, you'll need to specify the port (shortcuts: `Command+T` on macOS, `Ctrl+T` on Linux/Windows) to `19001`. After that, run your project with `expo start`, and select `Debug remote JS` from the Developer Menu. The debugger should automatically connect.

In the debugger console, you can see the Element tree, as well as the props, state, and children of whatever element you select. You also have the Chrome console on the right, and if you type `$r` in the console, you will see the breakdown of your selected element.

If you right-click anywhere in the React Native Debugger, you'll get some handy short-cuts to reload your JS, enable/disable the element inspector, network inspector, and to log and clear your `AsyncStorage` content.

### Inspecting network traffic

It's easy to use the React Native Debugger to debug your network requests. Simple right-click to `Enable Network Inspect`, which allows you to open the Network tab and inspect requests of `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest`. There are [some limitations](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/blob/master/docs/network-inspect-of-chrome-devtools.md#limitations), so there are a few other alternatives, all require using a proxy. The following options will all work:

- [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/configuration/browser-and-system-configuration/) (\$50 USD, our preferred tool)
- [mitmproxy](https://medium.com/@rotxed/how-to-debug-http-s-traffic-on-android-7fbe5d2a34#.hnhanhyoz)
- [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler)

On Android, the [Proxy Settings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lechucksoftware.proxy.proxysettings) app is helpful for switch between debug and non-debug mode. Unfortunately it doesn't work with Android M yet.

## Debugging Redux

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a popular library for managing the state of your app that doesn't belong to any single component, and instead it shared throughout the app. You can use the React Native Debugger (told you this tool does it all), the set up is as follows:

1. Download React Native Debugger from the [releases page](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases).
2. Open the app, press `⌘+t`/`ctrl+t` to open new window, then set the port to 19001.
3. Start your app, open the in-app developer menu, and select “Debug JS Remotely.”
4. Configure `__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__` as [shown here](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#11-basic-store).

You're now good to go! If you are experiencing any issues or want to learn more about how to use these tools, refer to this [guide](https://medium.com/@tetsuyahasegawa/how-to-integrate-react-native-debugger-to-your-expo-react-native-project-db1d631fad02).

## Debugging with React DevTools

React DevTools is a great way to get a look at each of your components' props and state. First, you'll need to run

```sh
npm install -g react-devtools@^3
```

(if you don't want to install it globally, run `npm install --dev react-devtools@^3` to install it as a project dependency).

After running `expo start` in your project's root directory, use a separate terminal tab to run `react-devtools`. This will open up the React Devtools console (for it to connect, you need to select `Debug remote JS` from the Developer Menu in the Expo Client). From this console, you can search for your React components at the top, or open up the Developer Menu and enable the Element Inspector. Once you do that, you can tap on any element on screen and React DevTools will automatically find and display that element in the tree. From there, you can inspect the elements state, props, etc.

<Video file="debugging/react-devtools.mp4" />

React DevTools can also be paired with remote debugging, allowing you to inspect props, state, and instance properties in the Chrome console. If you have any questions on setting that up, give the next section a look!

## Remote debugging with Chrome Developer Tools

You can debug Expo apps using the Chrome debugger tools. Rather than running your app's JavaScript on your phone, it will instead run it inside of a webworker in Chrome. You can then set breakpoints, inspect variables, execute code, etc, as you would when debugging a web app.

- To ensure the best debugging experience, first change your host type in Expo Dev Tools to `LAN` or `localhost`. If you use `Tunnel` with debugging enabled, you are likely to experience so much latency that your app is unusable. While here, also ensure that `Development Mode` is checked.

- If you are using `LAN`, make sure your device is on the same wifi network as your development machine. This may not work on some public networks. `localhost` will not work for iOS unless you are in the simulator, and it only work on Android if your device is connected to your machine via usb.

- Open the app on your device, reveal the developer menu then tap on `Debug JS Remotely`. This should open up a Chrome tab with the URL `http://localhost:19001/debugger-ui`. From there, you can set breakpoints and interact through the JavaScript console. Shake the device and stop Chrome debugging when you're done.

- Line numbers for `console.log` statements don't work by default when using Chrome debugging. To get correct line numbers open up the Chrome Dev Tools settings, go to the "Blackboxing" tab, make sure that "Blackbox content scripts" is checked, and add `expo/build/logs/RemoteConsole.js` as a pattern with "Blackbox" selected.

### Troubleshooting localhost debugging

When you start a project with Expo CLI and when you press `Run on Android device/emulator` in Expo Dev Tools (or `a` in the terminal), Expo CLI will automatically tell your device to forward `localhost:19000` and `19001` to your development machine, as long as your device is plugged in or emulator is running. If you are using `localhost` for debugging and it isn't working, close the app and open it up again using `Open on Android`. Alternatively, you can manually forward the ports using the following command if you have the Android developer tools installed: `adb reverse tcp:19000 tcp:19000` - `adb reverse tcp:19001 tcp:19001`

### Source maps and async functions

Source maps and async functions aren't 100% reliable. React Native doesn't play well with Chrome's source mapping in every case, so if you want to make sure you're breakpointing in the correct place, you should use the `debugger` call directly from your code.

## Other debugging tips

Dotan Nahum outlined in his ["Debugging React Native Applications" Medium post](https://medium.com/reactnativeacademy/debugging-react-native-applications-6bff3f28c375) other useful tools such as spying on bridge messages and JSEventLoopWatchdog.

## Debugging production apps with Sentry

In a perfect world, your app would ship without any bugs. However, that's usually not the case. So, it's usually a good idea to implement a crash and bug reporting system into your app. This way, if any user experiences a fatal JS error (or any event that you've configured to notify Sentry) you can see the details in your Sentry dashboard.

Expo provides a wrapper called [sentry-expo](../../guides/using-sentry/) which allows you to get as much information as possible from crashes and other events. Plus, when running in the managed workflow, you can configure sourcemaps so that the stracktraces you see in Sentry will look much more like the code in your editor.

## Stuck?

The Expo community and the React and React Native communities are great resources for help when you get stuck. There's a good chance someone else has run into the exact same error as you, so make sure to read the documentation, search the [forums](https://forums.expo.io/), [Github issues](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/), and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
